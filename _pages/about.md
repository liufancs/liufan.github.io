## A short introduction
I am currently a Research Fellow with [Prof. Mohan S. Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/) in [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I received my Ph.D degree at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/index.html). I received the B.Eng. degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) in China and the Master degree from the [Kansai University](https://www.kansai-u.ac.jp/) in Japan. My research interests include information retrieval and recommendation, multimedia and privacy preservation. I was a visiting scholar at [N-CRiPT@NUS](https://ncript.comp.nus.edu.sg/) in 2021.
