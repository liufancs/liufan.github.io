### About Me
I am currently a Research Fellow with [Prof. Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/) in [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I received my Ph.D degree at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/index.html) and [Prof. Zhiyong Cheng](https://sites.google.com/view/zycheng). I received the B.Eng. degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) in China and the Master degree from the [Kansai University](https://www.kansai-u.ac.jp/) in Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Ebara Hiroyuki](https://gakujo.kansai-u.ac.jp/profile/en/3b9d26c7eb2cecuf4f1fdf+f7077b.html). My research interests lie primarily in multimedia search and recommendation. I was a visiting scholar at [N-CRiPT@NUS](https://ncript.comp.nus.edu.sg/) in 2021.
